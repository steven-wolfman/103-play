# CPSC 103 Syzygy Automatic File Distribution

This folder contains a set of files distributed automatically to students in CPSC 103, with updates occurring each night.

As the term goes on, you should see a structure of folders (also known as directories) appear with files inside, usually Jupyter notebooks that you can open from here or from links we provide in Canvas.

You may occasionally wish you could get a fresh copy of our version of a file.

If you have *never edited* a file, it should automatically update itself anytime we make changes to it at the next overnight automatic update.

However, if you *have* edited a file, the system distributing files to you will avoid touching your edits. You should still be able to get back to our version of the file, however. Just rename your edited file (e.g., open the Jupyter notebook, click on the file name/title at the very top, and change it to something new). Then, at the next nightly update, the automatic system will discover that you don't have our file and put a fresh copy in place.

If you have questions, post on the class discussion board or send mail to cpsc103-admin@cs.ubc.ca!
